## FAQ

#### How do I get a Token?

First, you need to create a new app and get API token. Open [@CryptoBot](http://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay), go to [Crypto Pay](https://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay) and tap **Create App** to get API Token.

#### How to enable Webhooks?

Open [@CryptoBot](http://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay), go to [Crypto Pay](https://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay) â†’ MyÂ Apps, choose an app, then choose **Webhooks...** and tap ðŸŒ•Â **EnableÂ Webhooks**. Then enter the following link:
```bash
https://<YOUR WHMCS DOMAIN>/modules/gateways/callback/cryptobot.php
```

#### From which IP addresses are notifications sent via webhook?

Unfortunately, CryptoBot does not provide specific addresses. If you use a firewall (such as [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)), create a custom WAF rule that will skip all requests sent to your handler URL(https://.../modules/gateways/callback/cryptobot.php).

#### I made a bypass rule for webhook, but that opened the backdoor to possible DDoS attacks. How to fix it?

Open [@CryptoBot](http://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay), go to [Crypto Pay](https://t.me/CryptoBot?start=pay) â†’ MyÂ Apps, choose an app, then choose **Webhooks...** and tap ðŸŒ•Â **EnableÂ Webhooks**. Then enter the following link:
```bash
https://<YOUR WHMCS DOMAIN>/modules/gateways/callback/cryptobot.php?<RANDOM CHARACTERS WITHOUT SPACES>
```

Characters after the ? sign count as GET parameters that only you know. Now make a custom WAF rule (e.g. via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)) that checks the full URL path:
```bash
(starts_with(http.request.full_uri, "https://<YOUR WHMCS DOMAIN>/modules/gateways/callback/cryptobot.php?<RANDOM CHARACTERS WITHOUT SPACES>"))
```
